# checklist_dat

[@checklist_dat](http://twitter.com/checklist_dat) is a Twitter bot that generates an encouraging checklist. This repository contains a single JSON file containing a [Tracery](https://github.com/galaxykate/tracery) grammar for use with [Cheap Bots, Done Quick](http://cheapbotsdonequick.com/). It was made by [Daniel D. Beck](http://twitter.com/ddbeck).

The bot's profile and banner image come from a historic NASA photograph of the [first JATO assisted Flight](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/4857945683/in/photolist-8phf1c).
